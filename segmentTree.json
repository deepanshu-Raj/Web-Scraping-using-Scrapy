{"Paragraph": "A Segment Tree is a data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively, while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. \nThis includes finding the sum of consecutive array elements $a[l \\dots r]$, or finding the minimum element in a such a range in $O(\\log n)$ time. \nBetween answering such queries the Segment Tree allows modifying the array by replacing one element, or even change the elements of a whole subsegment (e.g. assigning all elements $a[l \\dots r]$ to any value, or adding a value to all element in the subsegment)."},
{"Paragraph": "In general a Segment Tree is a very flexible data structure, and a huge number of problems can be solved with it. \nAdditionally it is also possible to apply more complex operations and answer more complex queries (see "},
{"Paragraph": ").\nIn particular the Segment Tree can be easily generalized to larger dimensions. \nFor instance with a two-dimensional Segment Tree you can answer sum or minimum queries over some subrectangle of a given matrix.\nHowever only in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time."},
{"Paragraph": "One important property of Segment Trees is, that they require only a linear amount of memory.\nThe standard Segment Tree requires $4n$ vertices for working on an array of size $n$."},
{"Paragraph": "To start easy, we consider the simplest form of a Segment Tree. \nWe want to answer sum queries efficiently. \nThe formal definition of our task is:\nWe have an array $a[0 \\dots n-1]$, and the Segment Tree must be able to find the sum of elements between the indices $l$ and $r$ (i.e. computing the sum $\\sum_{i=l}^r a[i]$), and also handle changing values of the elements in the array (i.e. perform assignments of the form $a[i] = x$). \nThe Segment Tree should be able to process both queries in $O(\\log n)$ time."},
{"Paragraph": "So, what is a Segment Tree?"},
{"Paragraph": "We compute and store the sum of the elements of the whole array, i.e. the sum of the segment $a[0 \\dots n-1]$. \nWe then split the array into two halves $a[0 \\dots n/2]$ and $a[n/2+1 \\dots n-1]$ and compute the sum of each halve and store them. \nEach of these two halves in turn also split in half, their sums are computed and stored. \nAnd this process repeats until all segments reach size $1$. \nIn other words we start with the segment $a[0 \\dots n-1]$, split the current segment in half (if it has not yet become a segment containing a single element), and then calling the same procedure for both halves. \nFor each such segment we store the sum of the numbers on it."},
{"Paragraph": "We can say, that these segments form a binary tree: \nthe root of this tree is the segment $a[0 \\dots n-1]$, and each vertex (except leaf vertices) has exactly two child vertices. \nThis is why the data structure is called \"Segment Tree\", even though in most implementations the tree is not constructed explicitly (see "},
{"Paragraph": ")."},
{"Paragraph": "Here is a visual representation of such a Segment Tree over the array $a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]$:"},
{"Paragraph": "From this short description of the data structure, we can already conclude that a Segment Tree only requires a linear number of vertices. \nThe first level of the tree contains a single node (the root), the second level will contain two vertices, in the third it will contain four vertices, until the number of vertices reaches $n$. \nThus the number of vertices in the worst case can be estimated by the sum $1 + 2 + 4 + \\dots + 2^{\\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil} = 2^{\\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil + 1} \\lt 4n$."},
{"Paragraph": "It is worth noting that whenever $n$ is not a power of two, not all levels of the Segment Tree will be completely filled. \nWe can see that behavior in the image.\nFor now we can forget about this fact, but it will become important later during the implementation."},
{"Paragraph": "The height of the Segment Tree is $O(\\log n)$, because when going down from the root to the leaves the size of the segments decreases approximately by half."},
{"Paragraph": "Before constructing the segment tree, we need to decide:"},
{"Paragraph": "Note that a vertex is a \"leaf vertex\", if its corresponding segment covers only one value in the original array. It is present at the lowermost level of a segment tree. Its value would be equal to the (corresponding) element $a[i]$."},
{"Paragraph": "Now, for construction of the segment tree, we start at the bottom level (the leaf vertices) and assign them their respective values. On the basis of these values, we can compute the values of the previous level, using the "},
{"Paragraph": " function.\nAnd on the basis of those, we can compute the values of the previous, and repeat the procedure until we reach the root vertex."},
{"Paragraph": "It is convenient to describe this operation recursively in the other direction, i.e., from the root vertex to the leaf vertices. The construction procedure, if called on a non-leaf vertex, does the following:"},
{"Paragraph": "We start the construction at the root vertex, and hence, we are able to compute the entire segment tree."},
{"Paragraph": "The time complexity of this construction is $O(n)$, assuming that the merge operation is constant time (the merge operation gets called $n$ times, which is equal to the number of internal nodes in the segment tree)."},
{"Paragraph": "For now we are going to answer sum queries. As an input we receive two integers $l$ and $r$, and we have to compute the sum of the segment $a[l \\dots r]$ in $O(\\log n)$ time."},
{"Paragraph": "To do this, we will traverse the Segment Tree and use the precomputed sums of the segments.\nLet's assume that we are currently at the vertex that covers the segment $a[tl \\dots tr]$.\nThere are three possible cases."},
{"Paragraph": "The easiest case is when the segment $a[l \\dots r]$ is equal to the corresponding segment of the current vertex (i.e. $a[l \\dots r] = a[tl \\dots tr]$), then we are finished and can return the precomputed sum that is stored in the vertex."},
{"Paragraph": "Alternatively the segment of the query can fall completely into the domain of either the left or the right child.\nRecall that the left child covers the segment $a[tl \\dots tm]$ and the right vertex covers the segment $a[tm + 1 \\dots tr]$ with $tm = (tl + tr) / 2$. \nIn this case we can simply go to the child vertex, which corresponding segment covers the query segment, and execute the algorithm described here with that vertex."},
{"Paragraph": "And then there is the last case, the query segment intersects with both children. \nIn this case we have no other option as to make two recursive calls, one for each child.\nFirst we go to the left child, compute a partial answer for this vertex (i.e. the sum of values of the intersection between the segment of the query and the segment of the left child), then go to the right child, compute the partial answer using that vertex, and then combine the answers by adding them. \nIn other words, since the left child represents the segment $a[tl \\dots tm]$ and the right child the segment $a[tm+1 \\dots tr]$, we compute the sum query $a[l \\dots tm]$ using the left child, and the sum query $a[tm+1 \\dots r]$ using the right child."},
{"Paragraph": "So processing a sum query is a function that recursively calls itself once with either the left or the right child (without changing the query boundaries), or twice, once for the left and once for the right child (by splitting the query into two subqueries). \nAnd the recursion ends, whenever the boundaries of the current query segment coincides with the boundaries of the segment of the current vertex. \nIn that case the answer will be the precomputed value of the sum of this segment, which is stored in the tree."},
{"Paragraph": "In other words, the calculation of the query is a traversal of the tree, which spreads through all necessary branches of the tree, and uses the precomputed sum values of the segments in the tree."},
{"Paragraph": "Obviously we will start the traversal from the root vertex of the Segment Tree."},
{"Paragraph": "The procedure is illustrated in the following image.\nAgain the array $a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]$ is used, and here we want to compute the sum $\\sum_{i=2}^4 a[i]$.\nThe colored vertices will be visited, and we will use the precomputed values of the green vertices.\nThis gives us the result $-2 + 1 = -1$."},
{"Paragraph": "Why is the complexity of this algorithm $O(\\log n)$?\nTo show this complexity we look at each level of the tree. \nIt turns out, that for each level we only visit not more than four vertices. \nAnd since the height of the tree is $O(\\log n)$, we receive the desired running time."},
{"Paragraph": "We can show that this proposition (at most four vertices each level) is true by induction.\nAt the first level, we only visit one vertex, the root vertex, so here we visit less than four vertices. \nNow let's look at an arbitrary level.\nBy induction hypothesis, we visit at most four vertices. \nIf we only visit at most two vertices, the next level has at most four vertices. That trivial, because each vertex can only cause at most two recursive calls. \nSo let's assume that we visit three or four vertices in the current level. \nFrom those vertices, we will analyze the vertices in the middle more carefully. \nSince the sum query asks for the sum of a continuous subarray, we know that segments corresponding to the visited vertices in the middle will be completely covered by the segment of the sum query. \nTherefore these vertices will not make any recursive calls. \nSo only the most left, and the most right vertex will have the potential to make recursive calls. \nAnd those will only create at most four recursive calls, so also the next level will satisfy the assertion.\nWe can say that one branch approaches the left boundary of the query, and the second branch approaches the right one."},
{"Paragraph": "Therefore we visit at most $4 \\log n$ vertices in total, and that is equal to a running time of $O(\\log n)$."},
{"Paragraph": "In conclusion the query works by dividing the input segment into several sub-segments for which all the sums are already precomputed and stored in the tree. \nAnd if we stop partitioning whenever the query segment coincides with the vertex segment, then we only need $O(\\log n)$ such segments, which gives the effectiveness of the Segment Tree."},
{"Paragraph": "Now we want to modify a specific element in the array, let's say we want to do the assignment $a[i] = x$. \nAnd we have to rebuild the Segment Tree, such that it correspond to the new, modified array."},
{"Paragraph": "This query is easier than the sum query. \nEach level of a Segment Tree forms a partition of the array. \nTherefore an element $a[i]$ only contributes to one segment from each level. \nThus only $O(\\log n)$ vertices need to be updated."},
{"Paragraph": "It is easy to see, that the update request can be implemented using a recursive function. \nThe function gets passed the current tree vertex, and it recursively calls itself with one of the two child vertices (the one that contains $a[i]$ in its segment), and after that recomputes its sum value, similar how it is done in the build method (that is as the sum of its two children)."},
{"Paragraph": "Again here is a visualization using the same array.\nHere we perform the update $a[2] = 3$.\nThe green vertices are the vertices that we visit and update."},
{"Paragraph": "The main consideration is how to store the Segment Tree.\nOf course we can define a $\\text{Vertex}$ struct and create objects, that store the boundaries of the segment, its sum and additionally also pointers to its child vertices.\nHowever this requires storing a lot of redundant information.\nWe will use a simple trick, to make this a lot more efficient. \nWe only store the sums in an array.\nThe sum of the root vertex at index 1, the sums of its two child vertices at indices 2 and 3, the sums of the children of those two vertices at indices 4 to 7, and so on. \nIt is easy to see, that the left child of a vertex at index $i$ is stored at index $2i$, and the right one at index $2i + 1$."},
{"Paragraph": "This simplifies the implementation a lot. \nWe don't need to store the structure of the tree in memory. \nIt is defined implicitly. \nWe only need one array which contains the sums of all segments."},
{"Paragraph": "As noted before, we need to store at most $4n$ vertices.\nIt might be less, but for convenience we always allocate an array of size $4n$.\nThere will be some elements in the sum array, that will not correspond to any vertices in the actual tree, but this doesn't complicate the implementation."},
{"Paragraph": "So, we store the Segment Tree simply as an array $t[]$ with a size of four times the input size $n$:"},
{"Paragraph": "The procedure for constructing the Segment Tree from a given array $a[]$ looks like this: \nit is a recursive function with the parameters $a[]$ (the input array), $v$ (the index of the current vertex), and the boundaries $tl$ and $tr$ of the current segment. \nIn the main program this function will be called with the parameters of the root vertex: $v = 1$, $tl = 0$, and $tr = n - 1$."},
{"Paragraph": "Further the function for answering sum queries is also a recursive function, which receives as parameters information about the current vertex/segment (i.e. the index $v$ and the boundaries $tl$ and $tr$) and also the information about the boundaries of the query, $l$ and $r$. \nIn order to simplify the code, this function always does two recursive calls, even if only one is necessary - in that case the superfluous recursive call will have $l > r$, and this can easily be caught using an additional check at the beginning of the function."},
{"Paragraph": "Finally the update query. The function will also receive information about the current vertex/segment, and additionally also the parameter of the update query (i.e. the position of the element and its new value)."},
{"Paragraph": "Most people use the implementation from the previous section. If you look at the array "},
{"Paragraph": " you can see that it follows the numbering of the tree nodes in the order of a BFS traversal (level-order traversal). \nUsing this traversal the children of vertex $v$ are $2v$ and $2v + 1$ respectively.\nHowever if $n$ is not a power of two, this method will skip some indices and leave some parts of the array "},
{"Paragraph": " unused.\nThe memory consumption is limited by $4n$, even though a Segment Tree of an array of $n$ elements requires only $2n - 1$ vertices."},
{"Paragraph": "However it can be reduced. \nWe renumber the vertices of the tree in the order of an Euler tour traversal (pre-order traversal), and we write all these vertices next to each other."},
{"Paragraph": "Lets look at a vertex at index $v$, and let him be responsible for the segment $[l, r]$, and let $mid = \\dfrac{l + r}{2}$.\nIt is obvious that the left child will have the index $v + 1$.\nThe left child is responsible for the segment $[l, mid]$, i.e. in total there will be $2 * (mid - l + 1) - 1$ vertices in the left child's subtree.\nThus we can compute the index of the right child of $v$. The index will be $v + 2 * (mid - l + 1)$.\nBy this numbering we achieve a reduction of the necessary memory to $2n$."},
{"Paragraph": "A Segment Tree is a very flexible data structure, and allows variations and extensions in many different directions. \nLet's try to categorize them below."},
{"Paragraph": "It can be quite easy to change the Segment Tree in a direction, such that it computes different queries (e.g. computing the minimum / maximum instead of the sum), but it also can be very nontrivial."},
{"Paragraph": "Let us slightly change the condition of the problem described above: instead of querying the sum, we will now make maximum queries."},
{"Paragraph": "The tree will have exactly the same structure as the tree described above. \nWe only need to change the way $t[v]$ is computed in the $\\text{build}$ and $\\text{update}$ functions.\n$t[v]$ will now store the maximum of the corresponding segment. \nAnd we also need to change the calculation of the returned value of the $\\text{sum}$ function (replacing the summation by the maximum)."},
{"Paragraph": "Of course this problem can be easily changed into computing the minimum instead of the maximum."},
{"Paragraph": "Instead of showing an implementation to this problem, the implementation will be given to a more complex version of this problem in the next section."},
{"Paragraph": "This task is very similar to the previous one.\nIn addition of finding the maximum, we also have to find the number of occurrences of the maximum."},
{"Paragraph": "To solve this problem, we store a pair of numbers at each vertex in the tree: \nIn addition to the maximum we also store the number of occurrences of it in the corresponding segment. \nDetermining the correct pair to store at $t[v]$ can still be done in constant time using the information of the pairs stored at the child vertices. \nCombining two such pairs should be done in a separate function, since this will be an operation that we will do while building the tree, while answering maximum queries and while performing modifications."},
{"Paragraph": "In this problem we want to compute the GCD / LCM of all numbers of given ranges of the array."},
{"Paragraph": "This interesting variation of the Segment Tree can be solved in exactly the same way as the Segment Trees we derived for sum / minimum / maximum queries:\nit is enough to store the GCD / LCM of the corresponding vertex in each vertex of the tree. \nCombining two vertices can be done by computing the GCM / LCM of both vertices."},
{"Paragraph": "In this problem we want to find the number of zeros in a given range, and additionally find the index of the $k$-th zero using a second function."},
{"Paragraph": "Again we have to change the store values of the tree a bit:\nThis time we will store the number of zeros in each segment in $t[]$. \nIt is pretty clear, how to implement the $\\text{build}$, $\\text{update}$ and $\\text{count_zero}$ functions, we can simply use the ideas from the sum query problem.\nThus we solved the first part of the problem."},
{"Paragraph": "Now we learn how to solve the problem of finding the $k$-th zero in the array $a[]$. \nTo do this task, we will descend the Segment Tree, starting at the root vertex, and moving each time to either the left or the right child, depending on which segment contains the $k$-th zero.\nIn order to decide to which child we need to go, it is enough to look at the number of zeros appearing in the segment corresponding to the left vertex.\nIf this precomputed count is greater or equal to $k$, it is necessary to descend to the left child, and otherwise descent to the right child.\nNotice, if we chose the right child, we have to subtract the number of zeros of the left child from $k$."},
{"Paragraph": "In the implementation we can handle the special case, $a[]$ containing less than $k$ zeros, by returning -1."},
{"Paragraph": "The task is as follows: \nfor a given value $x$ we have to quickly find smallest index $i$ such that the sum of the first $i$ elements of the array $a[]$ is greater or equal to $x$ (assuming that the array $a[]$ only contains non-negative values)."},
{"Paragraph": "This task can be solved using binary search, computing the sum of the prefixes with the Segment Tree.\nHowever this will lead to a $O(\\log^2 n)$ solution."},
{"Paragraph": "Instead we can use the same idea as in the previous section, and find the position by descending the tree:\nby moving each time to the left or the right, depending on the sum of the left child.\nThus finding the answer in $O(\\log n)$ time."},
{"Paragraph": "The task is as follows: \nfor a given value $x$ and a range $a[l \\dots r]$ find the smallest $i$  in the range $a[l \\dots r]$, such that $a[i]$ is greater than $x$."},
{"Paragraph": "This task can be solved using binary search over max prefix queries with the Segment Tree.\nHowever, this will lead to a $O(\\log^2 n)$ solution."},
{"Paragraph": "Instead, we can use the same idea as in the previous sections, and find the position by descending the tree:\nby moving each time to the left or the right, depending on the maximum value of the left child.\nThus finding the answer in $O(\\log n)$ time."},
{"Paragraph": "Here again we receive a range $a[l \\dots r]$ for each query, this time we have to find a subsegment $a[l^\\prime \\dots r^\\prime]$ such that $l \\le l^\\prime$ and $r^\\prime \\le r$ and the sum of the elements of this segment is maximal. \nAs before we also want to be able to modify individual elements of the array. \nThe elements of the array can be negative, and the optimal subsegment can be empty (e.g. if all elements are negative)."},
{"Paragraph": "This problem is a non-trivial usage of a Segment Tree.\nThis time we will store four values for each vertex: \nthe sum of the segment, the maximum prefix sum, the maximum suffix sum, and the sum of the maximal subsegment in it.\nIn other words for each segment of the Segment Tree the answer is already precomputed as well as the answers for segments touching the left and the right boundaries of the segment."},
{"Paragraph": "How to build a tree with such data?\nAgain we compute it in a recursive fashion: \nwe first compute all four values for the left and the right child, and then combine those to archive the four values for the current vertex.\nNote the answer for the current vertex is either:"},
{"Paragraph": "Hence the answer to the current vertex is the maximum of these three values. \nComputing the maximum prefix / suffix sum is even easier. \nHere is the implementation of the $\\text{combine}$ function, which receives only data from the left and right child, and returns the data of the current vertex."},
{"Paragraph": "Using the $\\text{combine}$ function it is easy to build the Segment Tree. \nWe can implement it in exactly the same way as in the previous implementations.\nTo initialize the leaf vertices, we additionally create the auxiliary function $\\text{make_data}$, which will return a $\\text{data}$ object holding the information of a single value."},
{"Paragraph": "It only remains, how to compute the answer to a query. \nTo answer it, we go down the tree as before, breaking the query into several subsegments that coincide with the segments of the Segment Tree, and combine the answers in them into a single answer for the query.\nThen it should be clear, that the work is exactly the same as in the simple Segment Tree, but instead of summing / minimizing / maximizing the values, we use the $\\text{combine}$ function."},
{"Paragraph": "This is a separate subsection that stands apart from the others, because at each vertex of the Segment Tree we don't store information about the corresponding segment in compressed form (sum, minimum, maximum, ...), but store all elements of the segment.\nThus the root of the Segment Tree will store all elements of the array, the left child vertex will store the first half of the array, the right vertex the second half, and so on."},
{"Paragraph": "In its simplest application of this technique we store the elements in sorted order.\nIn more complex versions the elements are not stored in lists, but more advanced data structures (sets, maps, ...). \nBut all these methods have the common factor, that each vertex requires linear memory (i.e. proportional to the length of the corresponding segment)."},
{"Paragraph": "The first natural question, when considering these Segment Trees, is about memory consumption.\nIntuitively this might look like $O(n^2)$ memory, but it turns out that the complete tree will only need $O(n \\log n)$ memory.\nWhy is this so?\nQuite simply, because each element of the array falls into $O(\\log n)$ segments (remember the height of the tree is $O(\\log n)$)."},
{"Paragraph": "So in spite of the apparent extravagance of such a Segment Tree, it consumes only slightly more memory than the usual Segment Tree."},
{"Paragraph": "Several typical applications of this data structure are described below.\nIt is worth noting the similarity of these Segment Trees with 2D data structures (in fact this is a 2D data structure, but with rather limited capabilities)."},
{"Paragraph": "We want to answer queries of the following form: \nfor three given numbers $(l, r, x)$ we have to find the minimal number in the segment $a[l \\dots r]$ which is greater than or equal to $x$."},
{"Paragraph": "We construct a Segment Tree. \nIn each vertex we store a sorted list of all numbers occurring in the corresponding segment, like described above. \nHow to build such a Segment Tree as effectively as possible?\nAs always we approach this problem recursively: let the lists of the left and right children already be constructed, and we want to build the list for the current vertex.\nFrom this view the operation is known trivial and can be accomplished in linear time:\nWe only need to combine the two sorted lists into one, which can be done by iterating over them using two pointers. \nThe C++ STL already has an implementation of this algorithm."},
{"Paragraph": "Because this structure of the Segment Tree and the similarities to the merge sort algorithm, the data structure is also often called \"Merge Sort Tree\"."},
{"Paragraph": "We already know that the Segment Tree constructed in this way will require $O(n \\log n)$ memory.\nAnd thanks to this implementation its construction also takes $O(n \\log n)$ time, after all each list is constructed in linear time in respect to its size."},
{"Paragraph": "Now consider the answer to the query. \nWe will go down the tree, like in the regular Segment Tree, breaking our segment $a[l \\dots r]$ into several subsegments (into at most $O(\\log n)$ pieces). \nIt is clear that the answer of the whole answer is the minimum of each of the subqueries.\nSo now we only need to understand, how to respond to a query on one such subsegment that corresponds with some vertex of the tree."},
{"Paragraph": "We are at some vertex of the Segment Tree and we want to compute the answer to the query, i.e. find the minimum number greater that or equal to a given number $x$. \nSince the vertex contains the list of elements in sorted order, we can simply perform a binary search on this list and return the first number, greater than or equal to $x$."},
{"Paragraph": "Thus the answer to the query in one segment of the tree takes $O(\\log n)$ time, and the entire query is processed in $O(\\log^2 n)$."},
{"Paragraph": "The constant $\\text{INF}$ is equal to some large number that is bigger than all numbers in the array. \nIts usage means, that there is no number greater than or equal to $x$ in the segment. \nIt has the meaning of \"there is no answer in the given interval\"."},
{"Paragraph": "This task is similar to the previous.\nThe last approach has a disadvantage, it was not possible to modify the array between answering queries.\nNow we want to do exactly this: a modification query will do the assignment $a[i] = y$."},
{"Paragraph": "The solution is similar to the solution of the previous problem, but instead of lists at each vertex of the Segment Tree, we will store a balanced list that allows you to quickly search for numbers, delete numbers, and insert new numbers. \nSince the array can contain a number repeated, the optimal choice is the data structure $\\text{multiset}$."},
{"Paragraph": "The construction of such a Segment Tree is done in pretty much the same way as in the previous problem, only now we need to combine $\\text{multiset}$s and not sorted lists.\nThis leads to a construction time of $O(n \\log^2 n)$ (in general merging two red-black trees can be done in linear time, but the C++ STL doesn't guarantee this time complexity)."},
{"Paragraph": "The $\\text{query}$ function is also almost equivalent, only now the $\\text{lower_bound}$ function of the $\\text{multiset}$ function should be called instead ($\\text{std::lower_bound}$ only works in $O(\\log n)$ time if used with random-access iterators)."},
{"Paragraph": "Finally the modification request. \nTo process it, we must go down the tree, and modify all $\\text{multiset}$ from the corresponding segments that contain the effected element.\nWe simply delete the old value of this element (but only one occurrence), and insert the new value."},
{"Paragraph": "Processing of this modification query also takes $O(\\log^2 n)$ time."},
{"Paragraph": "We have the same problem statement, we want to find the minimal number greater than or equal to $x$ in a segment, but this time in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nWe will improve the time complexity using the technique \"fractional cascading\"."},
{"Paragraph": "Fractional cascading is a simple technique that allows you to improve the running time of multiple binary searches, which are conducted at the same time. \nOur previous approach to the search query was, that we divide the task into several subtasks, each of which is solved with a binary search. \nFractional cascading allows you to replace all of these binary searches with a single one."},
{"Paragraph": "The simplest and most obvious example of fractional cascading is the following problem:\nthere are $k$ sorted lists of numbers, and we must find in each list the first number greater than or equal to the given number."},
{"Paragraph": "Instead of performing a binary search for each list, we could merge all lists into one big sorted list.\nAdditionally for each element $y$ we store a list of results of searching for $y$ in each of the $k$ lists.\nTherefore if we want to find the smallest number greater than or equal to $x$, we just need to perform one single binary search, and from the list of indices we can determine the smallest number in each list.\nThis approach however requires $O(n \\cdot k)$ ($n$ is the length of the combined lists), which can be quite inefficient."},
{"Paragraph": "Fractional cascading reduces this memory complexity to $O(n)$ memory, by creating from the $k$ input lists $k$ new lists, in which each list contains the corresponding list and additionally also every second element of the following new list.\nUsing this structure it is only necessary to store two indices, the index of the element in the original list, and the index of the element in the following new list.\nSo this approach only uses $O(n)$ memory, and still can answer the queries using a single binary search."},
{"Paragraph": "But for our application we do not need the full power of fractional cascading.\nIn our Segment Tree a vertex will contain the sorted list of all elements that occur in either the left or the right subtrees (like in the Merge Sort Tree). \nAdditionally to this sorted list, we store two positions for each element.\nFor an element $y$ we store the smallest index $i$, such that the $i$th element in the sorted list of the left child is greater or equal to $y$.\nAnd we store the smallest index $j$, such that the $j$th element in the sorted list of the right child is greater or equal to $y$.\nThese values can be computed in parallel to the merging step when we build the tree."},
{"Paragraph": "How does this speed up the queries?"},
{"Paragraph": "Remember, in the normal solution we did a binary search in ever node.\nBut with this modification, we can avoid all except one."},
{"Paragraph": "To answer a query, we simply to a binary search in the root node.\nThis gives as the smallest element $y \\ge x$ in the complete array, but it also gives us two positions.\nThe index of the smallest element greater or equal $x$ in the left subtree, and the index of the smallest element $y$ in the right subtree. Notice that $\\ge y$ is the same as $\\ge x$, since our array doesn't contain any elements between $x$ and $y$.\nIn the normal Merge Sort Tree solution we would compute these indices via binary search, but with the help of the precomputed values we can just look them up in $O(1)$.\nAnd we can repeat that until we visited all nodes that cover our query interval."},
{"Paragraph": "To summarize, as usual we touch $O(\\log n)$ nodes during a query. In the root node we do a binary search, and in all other nodes we only do constant work.\nThis means the complexity for answering a query is $O(\\log n)$."},
{"Paragraph": "But notice, that this uses three times more memory than a normal Merge Sort Tree, which already uses a lot of memory ($O(n \\log n)$)."},
{"Paragraph": "It is straightforward to apply this technique to a problem, that doesn't require any modification queries.\nThe two positions are just integers and can easily be computed by counting when merging the two sorted sequences."},
{"Paragraph": "It it still possible to also allow modification queries, but that complicates the entire code.\nInstead of integers, you need to store the sorted array as "},
{"Paragraph": ", and instead of indices you need to store iterators.\nAnd you need to work very carefully, so that you increment or decrement the correct iterators during a modification query."},
{"Paragraph": "This technique implies a whole new class of possible applications. \nInstead of storing a $\\text{vector}$ or a $\\text{multiset}$ in each vertex, other data structures can be used:\nother Segment Trees (somewhat discussed in "},
{"Paragraph": "), Fenwick Trees, Cartesian trees, etc."},
{"Paragraph": "All problems in the above sections discussed modification queries that only effected a single element of the array each.\nHowever the Segment Tree allows applying modification queries to an entire segment of contiguous elements, and perform the query in the same time $O(\\log n)$."},
{"Paragraph": "We begin by considering problems of the simplest form: the modification query should add a number $x$ to all numbers in the segment $a[l \\dots r]$.\nThe second query, that we are supposed to answer, asked simply for the value of $a[i]$."},
{"Paragraph": "To make the addition query efficient, we store at each vertex in the Segment Tree how many we should add to all numbers in the corresponding segment. \nFor example, if the query \"add 3 to the whole array $a[0 \\dots n-1]$\" comes, then we place the number 3 in the root of the tree.\nIn general we have to place this number multiple to multiple segments, which form a partition of the query segment. \nThus we don't have to change all $O(n)$ values, but only $O(\\log n)$ many."},
{"Paragraph": "If now there comes a query that asks the current value of a particular array entry, it is enough to go down the tree and add up all values found along the way."},
{"Paragraph": "Suppose now that the modification query asks to assign each element of a certain segment $a[l \\dots r]$ to some value $p$.\nAs a second query we will again consider reading the value of the array $a[i]$."},
{"Paragraph": "To perform this modification query on a whole segment, you have to store at each vertex of the Segment Tree whether the corresponding segment is covered entirely with the same value or not.\nThis allows us to make a \"lazy\" update: \ninstead of changing all segments in the tree that cover the query segment, we only change some, and leave others unchanged.\nA marked vertex will mean, that every element of the corresponding segment is assigned to that value, and actually also the complete subtree should only contain this value.\nIn a sense we are lazy and delay writing the new value to all those vertices.\nWe can do this tedious task later, if this is necessary."},
{"Paragraph": "So after the modification query is executed, some parts of the tree become irrelevant - some modifications remain unfulfilled in it."},
{"Paragraph": "For example if a modification query \"assign a number to the whole array $a[0 \\dots n-1]$\" gets executed, in the Segment Tree only a single change is made - the number is placed in the root of the tree and this vertex gets marked.\nThe remaining segments remain unchanged, although in fact the number should be placed in the whole tree."},
{"Paragraph": "Suppose now that the second modification query says, that the first half of the array $a[0 \\dots n/2]$ should be assigned with some other number. \nTo process this query we must assign each element in the whole left child of the root vertex with that number. \nBut before we do this, we must first sort out the root vertex first. \nThe subtlety here is that the right half of the array should still be assigned to the value of the first query, and at the moment there is no information for the right half stored."},
{"Paragraph": "The way to solve this is to push the information of the root to its children, i.e. if the root of the tree was assigned with any number, then we assign the left and the right child vertices with this number and remove the mark of the root.\nAfter that, we can assign the left child with the new value, without loosing any necessary information."},
{"Paragraph": "Summarizing we get:\nfor any queries (a modification or reading query) during the descent along the tree we should always push information from the current vertex into both of its children. \nWe can understand this in such a way, that when we descent the tree we apply delayed modifications, but exactly as much as necessary (so not to degrade the complexity of $O(\\log n)$."},
{"Paragraph": "For the implementation we need to make a $\\text{push}$ function, which will receive the current vertex, and it will push the information for its vertex to both its children. \nWe will call this function at the beginning of the query functions (but we will not call it from the leaves, because there is no need to push information from them any further)."},
{"Paragraph": "Notice: the function $\\text{get}$ can also be implemented in a different way: \ndo not make delayed updates, but immediately return the value $t[v]$ if $marked[v]$ is true."},
{"Paragraph": "Now the modification query is to add a number to all elements in a range, and the reading query is to find the maximum in a range."},
{"Paragraph": "So for each vertex of the Segment Tree we have to store the maximum of the corresponding subsegment. \nThe interesting part is how to recompute these values during a modification request."},
{"Paragraph": "For this purpose we keep store an additional value for each vertex. \nIn this value we store the addends we haven't propagated to the child vertices.\nBefore traversing to a child vertex, we call $\\text{push}$ and propagate the value to both children.\nWe have to do this in both the $\\text{update}$ function and the $\\text{query}$ function."},
{"Paragraph": "A Segment Tree can be generalized quite natural to higher dimensions.\nIf in the one-dimensional case we split the indices of the array into segments, then in the two-dimensional we make an ordinary Segment Tree with respect to the first indices, and for each segment we build an ordinary Segment Tree with respect to the second indices."},
{"Paragraph": "A matrix $a[0 \\dots n-1, 0 \\dots m-1]$ is given, and we have to find the sum (or minimum/maximum) on some submatrix $a[x_1 \\dots x_2, y_1 \\dots y_2]$, as well as perform modifications of individual matrix elements (i.e. queries of the form $a[x][y] = p$)."},
{"Paragraph": "So we build a 2D Segment Tree: first the Segment Tree using the first coordinate ($x$), then the second ($y$)."},
{"Paragraph": "To make the construction process more understandable, you can forget for a while that the matrix is two-dimensional, and only leave the first coordinate.\nWe will construct an ordinary one-dimensional Segment Tree using only the first coordinate.\nBut instead of storing a number in a segment, be store an entire Segment Tree: \ni.e. at this moment we remember that we also have a second coordinate; but because at this moment the first coordinate is already fixed to some interval $[l \\dots r]$, we actually work with such a strip $a[l \\dots r, 0 \\dots m-1]$ and for it we build a Segment Tree."},
{"Paragraph": "Here is the implementation of the construction of a 2D Segment Tree.\nIt actually represents two separate blocks: \nthe construction of a Segment Tree along the $x$ coordinate ($\\text{build}_x$), and the $y$ coordinate ($\\text{build}_y$).\nFor the leaf nodes in $\\text{build}_y$ we have to separate two cases: \nwhen the current segment of the first coordinate $[tlx \\dots trx]$ has length 1, and when it has a length greater than one. In the first case, we just take the corresponding value from the matrix, and in the second case we can combine the values of two Segment Trees from the left and the right son in the coordinate $x$."},
{"Paragraph": "Such a Segment Tree still uses a linear amount of memory, but with a larger constant: $16 n m$.\nIt is clear that the described procedure $\\text{build}_x$ also works in linear time."},
{"Paragraph": "Now we turn to processing of queries. We will answer to the two-dimensional query using the same principle: \nfirst break the query on the first coordinate, and then for every reached vertex, we call the corresponding Segment Tree of the second coordinate."},
{"Paragraph": "This function works in $O(\\log n \\log m)$ time, since it first descends the free in the first coordinate, and for each traversed vertex in the tree it makes a query in the corresponding Segment Tree along the second coordinate."},
{"Paragraph": "Finally we consider the modification query. \nWe want to learn how to modify the Segment Tree in accordance with the change in the value of some element $a[x][y] = p$.\nIt is clear, that the changes will occur only in those vertices of the first Segment Tree that cover the coordinate $x$ (and such will be $O(\\log n)$), and for Segment Trees corresponding to them the changes will only occurs at those vertices that covers the coordinate $y$ (and such will be $O(\\log m)$).\nTherefore the implementation will be not very different form the one-dimensional case, only now we first descend the first coordinate, and then the second."},
{"Paragraph": "Let the problem be the following: there are $n$ points on the plane given by their coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$ and queries of the form \"count the number of points lying in the rectangle $((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2))$\".\nIt is clear that in the case of such a problem it becomes unreasonably wasteful to construct a two-dimensional Segment Tree with $O(n^2)$ elements.\nMost on this memory will be wasted, since each single point can only get into $O(\\log n)$ segments of the tree along the first coordinate, and therefore the total \"useful\" size of all tree segments on the second coordinate is $O(n \\log n)$."},
{"Paragraph": "So we proceed as follows:\nat each vertex of the Segment Tree with respect to the first coordinate we store a Segment Tree constructed only by those second coordinates that occur in the current segment of the first coordinates. \nIn other words, when constructing a Segment Tree inside some vertex with index $vx$ and the boundaries $tlx$ and $trx$, we only consider those points that fall into this interval $x \\in [tlx, trx]$, and build a Segment Tree just using them."},
{"Paragraph": "Thus we will achieve that each Segment Tree on the second coordinate will occupy exactly as much memory as it should.\nAs a result, the total amount of memory will decrease to $O(n \\log n)$.\nWe still can answer the queries in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time, we just have to make a binary search on the second coordinate, but this will not worsen the complexity."},
{"Paragraph": "But modification queries will be impossible with this structure:\nin fact if a new point appears, we have to add a new element in the middle of some Segment Tree along the second coordinate, which cannot be effectively done."},
{"Paragraph": "In conclusion we note that the two-dimensional Segment Tree contracted in the described way becomes practically equivalent to the modification of the one-dimensional Segment Tree (see "},
{"Paragraph": ").\nIn particular the two-dimensional Segment Tree is just a special case of storing a subarray in each vertex of the tree.\nIt follows, that if you gave to abandon a two-dimensional Segment Tree due to the impossibility of executing a query, it makes sense to try to replace the nested Segment Tree with some more powerful data structure, for example a Cartesian tree."},
{"Paragraph": "A persistent data structure is a data structure that remembers it previous state for each modification.\nThis allows to access any version of this data structure that interest us and execute a query on it."},
{"Paragraph": "Segment Tree is a data structure that can be turned into a persistent data structure efficiently (both in time and memory consumption).\nWe want to avoid copying the complete tree before each modification, and we don't want to loose the $O(\\log n)$ time behavior for answering range queries."},
{"Paragraph": "In fact, any change request in the Segment Tree leads to a change in the data of only $O(\\log n)$ vertices along the path starting from the root. \nSo if we store the Segment Tree using pointers (i.e. a vertex stores pointers to the left and the right child vertices), then when performing the modification query, we simply need to create new vertices instead of changing the available vertices.\nVertices that are not affected by the modification query can still be used by pointing the pointers to the old vertices.\nThus for a modification query $O(\\log n)$ new vertices will be created, including a new root vertex of the Segment Tree, and the entire previous version of the tree rooted at the old root vertex will remain unchanged."},
{"Paragraph": "Let's give an example implementation for the simplest Segment Tree: when there is only a query asking for sums, and modification queries of single elements."},
{"Paragraph": "For each modification of the Segment Tree we will receive a new root vertex.\nTo quickly jump between two different versions of the Segment Tree, we need to store this roots in an array.\nTo use a specific version of the Segment Tree we simply call the query using the appropriate root vertex."},
{"Paragraph": "With the approach described above almost any Segment Tree can be turned into a persistent data structure."},
{"Paragraph": "This time we have to answer queries of the form \"What is the $k$-th smallest element in the range $a[l \\dots r]$. \nThis query can be answered using a binary search and a Merge Sort Tree, but the time complexity for a single query would be $O(\\log^3 n)$.\nWe will accomplish the same task using a persistent Segment Tree in $O(\\log n)$."},
{"Paragraph": "First we will discuss a solution for a simpler problem:\nWe will only consider arrays in which the elements are bound by $0 \\le a[i] \\lt n$.\nAnd we only want to find the $k$-th smallest element in some prefix of the array $a$.\nIt will be very easy to extent the developed ideas later for not restricted arrays and not restricted range queries."},
{"Paragraph": "We will use a Segment Tree that counts all appearing numbers, i.e. in the Segment Tree we will store the histogram of the array.\nSo the leaf vertices will store how often the values $0$, $1$, $\\dots$, $n-1$ will appear in the array, and the other vertices store how many numbers in some range are in the array. \nIn other words we create a regular Segment Tree with sum queries over the histogram of the array.\nBut instead of creating all $n$ Segment Trees for every possible prefix, we will create one persistent one, that will contain the same information.\nWe will start with an empty Segment Tree (all counts will be $0$), and add the elements $a[0]$, $a[1]$, $\\dots$, $a[n-1]$ one after each other.\nFor each modification we will receive a new root vertex, let's call $root_i$ the root of the Segment Tree after inserting the first $i$ elements of the array $a$.\nThe Segment Tree rooted at $root_i$ will contain the histogram of the prefix $a[0 \\dots i-1]$.\nUsing this Segment Tree we can find in $O(\\log n)$ time the position of the $k$-th element using the same technique discussed in "},
{"Paragraph": "."},
{"Paragraph": "Now to the not-restricted version of the problem."},
{"Paragraph": "First for the restriction on the array:\nWe can actually transform any array to such an array by index compression.\nThe smallest element in the array will gets assigned the value 0, the second smallest the value 1, and so forth.\nIt is easy to generate lookup tables (e.g. using $\\text{map}$), that convert a value to its index and vice versa in $O(\\log n)$ time."},
{"Paragraph": "Now to the queries restriction: \ninstead of only performing these queries over a prefix of $a$, we want to use any arbitrary segments $a[l \\dots r]$.\nHere we need a Segment Tree that represents the histogram of the elements in the range $a[l \\dots r]$. \nIt is easy to see that such a Segment Tree is just the difference between the Segment Tree rooted at $root_{r+1}$ and the Segment Tree rooted at $root_l$, i.e. every vertex in the $[l \\dots r]$ Segment Tree can be computed with the vertex of the $root_{r+1}$ tree minus the vertex of the $root_l$ tree.\nIn the implementation of the $\\text{get_kth}$ function this can be handled by passing two vertex pointer and computing the count/sum of the current segment as difference of the two counts/sums of the vertices."},
{"Paragraph": "Previously, we considered cases when we have the ability to build the original segment tree. But what to do if the original size is filled with some default element, but its size does not allow you to completely build up to it in advance?"},
{"Paragraph": "We can solve this problem by not explicitly creating a segment tree. Initially, we will create only the root, and we will create the other vertexes only when we need them. \nIn this case, we will use the implementation on pointers(before going to the vertex children, check whether they are created, and if not, create them).\nEach query has still only the complexity $O(\\log n)$, which is small enough for most use-cases (e.g. $\\log_2 10^9 \\approx 30$)."},
{"Paragraph": "In this implementation we have two queries, adding a value to a position (initially all values  are $0$), and computing the sum of all values in a range.\n"},
{"Paragraph": " will be the root vertex of the implicit tree."},
{"Paragraph": "Obviously this idea can be extended in lots of different ways. E.g. by adding support for range updates via lazy propagation."}
